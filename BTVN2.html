                <p>Cole Young, an MMA fighter accustomed to taking beatings for money, is unaware of his heritage or why Outworld's Emperor Shang Tsung has sent Sub-Zero, a deadly Cryomancer, to hunt him down. 
                    Fearing for his family's safety, Cole seeks out Sonya Blade with the help of Jax, a Special Forces Major who shares the same mysterious dragon marking as Cole. 
                    This search leads him to the temple of Lord Raiden, the Elder God and protector of Earthrealm, where he joins forces with warriors Liu Kang, Kung Lao, and rogue mercenary Kano.
                </p>
                <p>As Cole trains alongside these experienced fighters, he prepares to face the looming threat from Outworld in a battle for the universe. 
                    But to stand a chance, Cole must unlock his arcana, a powerful ability hidden deep within his soul. 
                    The stakes are high—not just for his family, but for the fate of Earthrealm itself.

                        Watching this movie brought back memories that I hadn't thought about since I was young . 
                        To make this short, The nostalgia was perfect, they had all the old champions with a few new mixed in.
                        The beginning was awesome, I really thought it was going to be a different Mortal Kombat movie, 
                        However, the beginning is the only drama you see after that its all fights. WHICH WERE AWESOME, but for people looking to see some sort of drama or decent script writing it falls very short.</td>

                        But even so, I enjoyed this movie. The fighting choreography is top notch! The costume, the cgi is also worth the hype. 
                        I love that they decided to make it rated R. But there's also some things that bothered me, like some bad cinematography, cheesy dialogues, and the somehow boring protagonist. 
                        The act 3 of the movie really felt rushed like the writers only had 5 minutes left to finish the script. 
                        I hope the sequel will have a better act 3.</td>

                    <td>Great visuals, excellent fight scenes, good choices on most of the cast (e.g Kano, Scorpion, Sub-Zero) and just a fun movie overall. 
                        If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.
                        Keep in mind that it's a trilogy, so this first film tries to add some background! Luckily there's not much time spent on meaningless conversations and the scenes get into the action parts faster than you would expect. 
                        Runtime of 1h 50min is works well; you will not be bored.
