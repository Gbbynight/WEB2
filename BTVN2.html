                <p>Black Myth: Wukong's first trailer in 2020. 
                    Boasting jaw-dropping visuals and flashy, action-packed combat, 
                    Black Myth: Wukong immediately drew me in with its gritty interpretation of the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West
                </p>
                <p>This isn't really about Wukong himself, or the trickster's actions through the ancient writings, 
                    but instead you take up the mantle of his successor of sorts. 
                    You play as a young, voiceless monkey many years after the fall of the god.

                    <td>"Black Myth: Wukong" is undoubtedly the most anticipated game of 2024, marking a groundbreaking moment for Chinese AAA single-player games. 
                        With its unique art style, exhilarating action gameplay, rich story content, and deep gaming experience, this action RPG based on the "Journey to the West" has quickly created a sensation since its release. 
                        Not only has it excited Chinese players, but it has also garnered widespread attention and high praise from both domestic and international media.</td>

                    <td>MacKong - Positive</td>
                    <td>This game, initially touted as an "action RPG," is actually much closer to a Souls-like, with challenging combat that requires precision, especially in dodging. 
                        While it has unique mechanics, like building energy for heavy attacks, the difficulty can be punishing, which may surprise players expecting a more traditional RPG experience. 
                        The Chinese mythological setting is beautifully presented, with AAA-quality cutscenes and stunning Unreal 5 visuals, although the world is quite linear. Despite some minor flaws, it's an impressive first release that may rank among the top games of the year—just be prepared for a tough challenge.</td>
