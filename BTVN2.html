                <p>Visually, Inside Out 2 is stunning. 
                    The animation is so detailed that I often felt like the solid-colored cartoon characters could step off the screen at any moment.
                    Anxiety and Joy's conversations are the most compelling, as the emotions spar over what they think is best for Riley. 
                    Anxiety wants to prepare her for everything that could go wrong, and Joy has been cheerily discarding Riley's unhappy memories.
                    The answer may be neither of those.
                </p>
                <p>Going into the sequel to a rightfully beloved movie, I decided to let Joy take the lead, and I chose optimism. 
                    I walked away satisfied, if not completely transformed. 
                    Parts of Inside Out 2 could seem too familiar to fans, but with effective humor, incredible animation and a willingness to explore a relevant new message, 
                    it's worth once again asking the question that kicked off the first film: What is going on inside someone's head?

                        We are also introduced to new emotions: embarrassment, Ennui (boredom), Envy and Anxiety.</td>

                        Disney and Pixar have been vastly disappointing and even controversial recently, 
                        but Inside Out 2 rivals Pixar's best movies like Up, Monsters inc., Ratatouille, The Incredibles and Toy Story in quality.</td>

                        The film lacked direction at times and felt quite disconnected. The first film had an amazing sense of journey and adventure and I think that's where this one missed the mark. 
                        The journey undertaken by the original characters simply didn't have the same sense of purpose the storyline felt 
                        forced to try and rush to the end where where we all learn lesson of the complexity of emotions are what life is about.</td>
